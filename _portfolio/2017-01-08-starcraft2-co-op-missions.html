      - The Missions section was a huge undertaking. The layout was defined by a grid
        of hexagons warped like a fish eye lens. Each one needed to trigger a mission
        overlay. The end solution was a finely tuned SVG used to create the polygon shaped
        interactive regions, masked images, and wraped text along a curved path.

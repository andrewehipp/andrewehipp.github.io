      - The championship bracket had 64 teams and spanned 6 stages before a champion could
        be crowned. Displaying every matchup in a single tournament bracket was a unique
        challenge that required a week of prototyping.
      - On desktop every match had to be positioned absolutely. <b>Sass</b> variables played
        a key role in maintaining the layout which was mirrored vertically and horizontally
      - On mobile as users navigated to different stages the bracket would resize and
        reposition itself.
      - <b>React.js</b> enabled dynamic bracket population during the user brackets phase.

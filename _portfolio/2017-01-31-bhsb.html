      - An easy to navigate responsive platform for a webcomic.
      - This site was treated as a playground for several different implementations.
        It has existed as a static <b>Jekyll</b> site, a <b>React.js</b> app using
        <b>Wordpress</b> as a <b>headless
        cms</b> and finally just a <b>Wordpress</b> site.

      - Readers have the choice to read panel by panel using the Dynamic Viewing option.
        Pages are scaled and translated to bring each panel into view.
      - Especially nice on smaller screens.
      - <b>Wordpress</b> with <b>Advanced Custom Fields</b> handled content uploading and entering varying numbers of views
        for each page.

      - All comics are archived. Each page is on display so a reader can easily jump back
        into the comic after missing a few pages.

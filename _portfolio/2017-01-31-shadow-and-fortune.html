      - The champion bios include animated illustrations of each champion. The state of
        the animation is tied to the mouse position and scroll top of the page. To add
        to the effect layers of mist are translated across the page and blended into the
        scene.

        have progress markers for each section. On page load javascript measures the height
        of the page and each section of the chapter. With these values each markers' position
        is calculated as a percentage from the top.
